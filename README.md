The Robotics Sensing and Navigation with GNSS Data Analysis project focuses on utilizing a USB-based GNSS puck to investigate GPS navigation. The aim of the project is to analyze collected data, estimate GPS errors, and gain insights into the distribution and source of these errors. By developing individual device drivers and conducting outdoor data collection, the project aims to understand the performance of GPS systems in stationary and moving scenarios, ultimately enhancing our understanding of robotics sensing and navigation.
